# Python Web Dev

---

Python, as an easily readable programming language, is easy to start with. This project aims to build a **Personal Blog**, implementing the basis of python programming.  
Instead of using well-designed Python Web Frameworks like Flask, Django, the project will develop the web from a low level which means it would start out from building Web Frames, ORM, MVC, API, then to CSS/HTML, JS, DOM, then to DevOps.
